As a dance studio owner, I want to show an organized schedule of classes so that I can help clients with their choices

(drop-ins/workshops with necessary information such as their pricing, time, date, venue, dance style, instructor name, instructor picture, and a clickable link to their faculty profile within either the instructor name or picture)

(programs with necessary information such as instructor/s, repetitive time-venue-day schedule, the program duration, the style of dance, the difficulty level)
